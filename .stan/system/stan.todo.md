# Development Plan (stan.todo.md)

When updated: 2025-08-29T14:10:00Z

## Next up

- Run `npm run diagrams` and confirm `diagrams/out/hello-world.png`
  renders (pinned to v18.0).
- When upgrading PlantUML locally, re-test awslabs v19/v20 and consider
  unpinning.

## Completed (recent)

- Pinned awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml to v18.0 in `diagrams/aws.pu`
  to match the Chocolatey PlantUML version and ensure reliable renders.
